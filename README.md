Here is a collection of all the graphs that were used (and some graphs that weren't). 
The data came from 4 excel spreadsheet, containing data from 4 different panels. 

The Jupyter notebook was used to take this data and generate the graphs and perform some calculations. 

The Final PDF of the dissertation is also uploaded. 

To run the JupyterNotebook, you'll need some sort of JupyterNotebook Environment. I reccommend installing anaconda for Windows and using JupyterLab.
